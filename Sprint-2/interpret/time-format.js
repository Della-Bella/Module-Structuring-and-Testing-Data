// You will need to play computer with this example - use the Python Visualiser https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit
// to help you answer these questions

// Questions

// a) When formatTimeDisplay is called how many times will pad be called?
3;

// Call formatTimeDisplay with an input of 61, now answer the following:

// b) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the first time?
//totalHours = 0 (calculated as (totalMinutes - remainingMinutes) / 60).
//pad is called first with totalHours.
// the value assigned to num is 0.

// c) What is the return value of pad is called for the first time?
//The first call to pad receives num = 0.
//Inside pad, 0 is converted to a string: "0".
//.padStart(2, "0") ensures it is at least 2 characters long by adding a leading zero: "00".
//The return value is "00"

// d) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
//The last call to pad is for remainingSeconds, which is 1:
//remainingSeconds = seconds % 60.
//With seconds = 61, remainingSeconds = 61 % 60 = 1.
// the value assigned to num is 1

// e) What is the return value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
//The last call to pad receives num = 1.
//Inside pad, 1 is converted to a string: "1".
//.padStart(2, "0") ensures it is at least 2 characters long by adding a leading zero: "01".
// return value is "01"
